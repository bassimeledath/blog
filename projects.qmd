Ask Priya is an LLM RAG chatbot that answers questions about US immigration using Google's chat bison model that is fed both the user question and retrieved immigration documents from a vector store. The vector store is built using Llama-index and the documents are scraped webpages from the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states).

Ask Priya performs way better than Ask Emma, the existing solution used by USCIS. Ask Priya also won first place in the [Truera Gen AI hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/truera-challenge-build-llm-applications).

Built using Python, Llama-index, VertexAI, OpenAI, Trulens, Streamlit etc.

Gemini Hire makes applying to jobs way easier using Gen AI. It parses your resume more effectively than Workday using Google's gemini vision pro into a json file. That json file, along with a user pasted job description, is then fed into 3 sub applications - a cover letter generator, interview questions generator and a skills gap analysis generator. These sub applications are mainly driven by Gemini Pro's text model. Evaluation is done using Trulens and OpenAI's API.

Built using Python, Gemini Vision Pro, OpenAI, Trulens, HuggingFace, Gradio etc.
